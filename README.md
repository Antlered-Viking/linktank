Linktank is a full stack application designed from the ground up to be a secure, privacy first webapp that lets users store links (or anything they like really) and attach tags, notes, and custom data to each link. The client application allows adding new items, viewing the current list, and making modifications to the items, as well as providing support for filtering and searching.
